<h1>The Best Flies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 go-to flies</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Chubby Chernobyl</h3>
<p>There is nothing more fun than watching a trout slam a big foam fly.</p>
<h3>Dave's Hopper</h3>
<p>This is great for late Summer/early Fall fishing. It can also work well on the swing.</p>
<h3>Wooly Bugger</h3>
<p>This is the first fly I ever fished with and it will catch fish anywhere in the world.</p>
